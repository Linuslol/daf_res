## Mandatory Naming Convention

## File structure
| type | convention                         | example  |
|------|------------------------------------|----------|
| dir  | all lowercase, only underscore     | this_dir |
| .md  | all lowercase, only underscore     | this_doc |
| img  | leading uppercase, only underscore | This_Img |
| c++  | leading uppercase (camelcase)      | ThisFile |
| func | leading uppercase (camelcase)      | ThisFunc |
| var  | all lowercase, only underscore     | this_var |
img as .png, .pdf, .dng or .svg <br>
use single dir for different things

## In Code
 - understandable short global variables (viewport_mode)
 - understandable short functions etc (SetImgInList)
 - short help variables (a, b, c)
 - names should be distinguishable
 - comments should be usefully and as short as possible

## Reserved Names
- x (x-coordinate)
- y (y-coordinate)
- r (red)
- g (green)
- b (blue)
- l (luma)
- img_link (link to an image, also includes all variations)
- px (pixel)
- left, right, top, bottom

## Git
 - commit massages should be like "added delete functionality"
 - issues should have checklists, use comments and edit
